The offline html file requires access to local javascript libraries included in the directory. 
Most mordern browsers do not allow this for security reasons. 
Firefox still allows it so if you have it, try to load it with Firefox first.

If firefox issues error or you prefer sticking to your favourite browser then another simple solution is the following 

Install python. cd into this dir and then issue :

 python -m SimpleHTTPServer  

which will spin up a web server hosting entire dir listing which you reference from URL on any browser :

http://localhost:8000


this is built into any python install (batteries are included). For python3 use this :

python3 -m http.server
